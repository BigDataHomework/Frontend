# Coal System (Front End)

It's to show a coal system by using **Vue** and **Echarts**

Because there still not have relative data, if you want to check relative functions. You can run by following ways:

### 1 open koa server

```bash
cd Frontend 
cd koa_server
node app.js
```

### 2 open localhost server

> make sure that you have installed 

```bash
cd Frontend
cd mainpage
npm run server
```

Your defualt webserver will respond in time by running on post:9000.

# In tasks-to-do.md is the charts that the page could show.
```
