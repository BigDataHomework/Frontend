# Coal System (Front End)

It's to show a coal system by using **Vue** and **Echarts**

Because there still not have relative data, if you want to check relative functions. You can run by following ways:

### 1 Open koa server

```bash
cd Frontend 
cd koa_server
node app.js
```

### 2 Open localhost server

> make sure that you have installed 

```bash
cd Frontend
cd mainpage
npm run server
```

Your defualt webserver will respond in time by running on post:9000.(If the post hasn't been occupied.)

The first page will be `localhost:9000/#`, here I just have done `localhost:9000/#/warningPage`, if you are interesting, try to check it!

### 3 Check successful functions

```bash
# In tasks-to-do.md is the charts that the page could show.
```
